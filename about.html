                    <h1>Further Explaination About Me</h1>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Let&#39;s start with this website name: <strong>Circle of Life</strong></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Actually, there&#39;s no thoughtful answer why I chose that name. The closest answer I could
                        provide is
                        <strong>random</strong>. But I could give you some background story how I came up with that
                        name.</p>
                    <p>I remember, at that time, I was in Gramedia Margonda [<a
                            href='https://goo.gl/maps/a6jX1h6mrNbW53dYA'>maps]</a>
                        and I was stumble upon at one particular book cover that has a cursive font that&#39;s said
                        &quot;Circle of
                        Life&quot;. And it has a bunch of fishs that surrounds that sentence.</p>
                    <p>I always thought, maybe... just maybe it resonates my hearts so well. I have no idea why but I
                        chose that cover
                        without any second thought.</p>
                    <p>After I get home, I look at that cover once again, and notice that there&#39;s one fish, that
                        stand out from the
                        other fish. All fish are in gray, except one particular fish. It&#39;s in yellow. And <strong>I
                            saw
                            myself</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I&#39;ve always an introverted person. Some people might say I&#39;m pretty weird, and I&#39;m
                        perfectly fine
                        with that because I give no shit to their opinions. I always try to be different, because I hate
                        to be similar
                        to others. I&#39;ve the very own standards that I believe, only the chosen one, could understand
                        it. And
                        that&#39;s why I love that cover so much.</p>
                    <p>Maybe I&#39;m just focusing too much on that fish. And you are right.</p>
                    <p>You know? Cause I&#39;ve no answer why I choose that name, I decided to google it and see if I
                        could find
                        something. And what I&#39;ve found is this:</p>

                    <div class="spotify">
                        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0juMU08O9byWiRBtKM1j5E" width="300"
                            height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>Such a legend song! I couldn’t believe I forget that song. The opening is so striking and since
                        it is in Zulu
                        language, I search for the meaning of the song. And here’s what it’s mean: <sup
                            class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-1' name='ref-footnote-1'>1</a></sup></p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The lyrics, like so much poetry, have some nuance that’s lost in English. <a
                                href='https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/circle-of-life-english-lyrics-lion-king/'>The
                                prosaic
                                translation</a> is: “Here comes a lion, father, Oh yes it’s a lion. A lion we’re going
                            to conquer, a
                            lion, a lion and a leopard come to this open place.”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>So maybe, that fish I talk earlier, is the king. But that doesn’t make any sense. Or it does. I
                        dunno.</p>
                    <p>So yeah… welcome to my very own weirdness. Enjoy.</p>
