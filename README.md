# About Me

I'm not sure if I could tell myself as a developer since I don't have any formal job at IT. My background is in Electronic Engineering, so I guess it's safe to assume I have a good understanding at IoT. 

No, it's not right. My thesis, in fact, is an parking slot detection. I'm using Python (obviously), a little bit of OpenCV (obviously also) for image-processing, and scikit-learn (well, I'm still beginner though). Maybe I can declare myself as an engineer with speciality in image-processing.

OK, this "about me page" getting no-where and confusing a lot of people.

# Future Plan

**Short Term**

Currently, I want to finish my training at Hacktiv8. After that, I'll get a chance to work at one of hospitals in Jakarta.

**Long Term**
Probably I wanna do a postgrad abroad. Still can't decide where, because my background isn't CS. I'm also not sure what kind of postgrad study I want to pick. But one thing for sure: data science and AI are my passion, and I want to get closer and closer each day to it. It's not easy and still blurry, but I'm sure I already heading on the right track.
